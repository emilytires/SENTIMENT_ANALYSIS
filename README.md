# SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative or neutral. Sentiment analysis models focus on polarity (positive, negative, neutral) but also on feelings and emotions (angry, happy, sad, etc), urgency (urgent, not urgent) and even intentions (interested v. not interested).
